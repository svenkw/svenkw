### Hi! I'm Svenkw!

This GitHub account really only exists because I have too many side projects, and never finish any of them. This would be a nice place to collect them all, in case I destroy my hard drive (again). 

As a result of my study (physics), I'm a Python boy now! So expect a lot of things that could be efficient written in this not-so-efficient language. 

I also like to make websites for things that do not need a website. So you can maybe find some of that here as well. 

Try not to cry while looking at my code, thanks.
